# COMP 523 - Language-Based Security - Final project

For the final project in this course, you will explore a more advanced topic in programming
languages.

The idea is to build on what you did in the homework, and extend it with some additional language
features. You do not have to start from your homework solutions, but these would pave the
groundwork.

Here's a selection of project ideas for you to consider.

- Call-by-Push-Value semantics: this paradigm subsumes eager and lazy operational semantics into
  one unified system.
- Dependent types: implement a small dependently-typed calculus and use it to carry out a few
  proofs about arithmetic on natural numbers
- Simple subtyping: follow ideas from the textbook to implement introduce a subtyping relation to
  your type system, for some basic arithmetic types like ints and floats.
- Object-oriented programming: follow ideas from the textbook to implement more advanced subtyping
  in the form of OOP subclasses.
- First-class polymorphism: implement System F and get into some deeper analysis of
  Church-encodings of datatypes
- Mechanizing the simply-typed lambda-calculus: use the proof assistant Agda to develop a
  formalization of some metatheory of the lambda-calculus that we studied.
- MiniCAML: build out a more realistic programming language involving user-defined polymorphic
  datatypes, full-blown pattern-matching, full type inference
  Some ideas for MiniCAML extensions:
  - efficient pattern matching by compiling to decision trees
  - translation into CPS
  - closure conversion
  - bytecode compilation
  - mutable variables
  - exceptions
  - typeclasses
  - ML-style modules
- Borrow-checking: develop a small, lightweight version of what Rust does
- Developing a realistic program (e.g. a game) in a dependently-typed language such as Idris
- Security type systems: statically guaranteeing that confidential information is not leaked
- Logic programming: develop something similar to Prolog, and use it to declaratively solve a few
  programming challenges
- Concurrency / communication / session types: type systems for concurrent, communicating programs
- Probabilistic programming: type systems for programs working with probability distributions
- Garbage collection: explore efficient garbage collection strategies
- Functional reactive programming: explore functional programming of reactive systems programmed as
  unbounded streams of events

You do not _have_ to pick from this list. Anything interesting, requiring some implementation
effort and relating to statically checking program correctness in some form is suitable.

The project will be used to assess the following competencies:

1. Communicates orally ideas of programming language theory.
2. Independently explores concepts in programming languages.
3. Works effectively in a team.

* The first two of these competencies will be assessed following the General CS Grading Rubrics.
* The third one will arise from a peer- and self-assessment: each team member will complete a short
  form to evaluate their own and their peers' teamwork performance.
* Project presentations will also be partly peer-assessed: each of you is expected to evaluate
  the presentations of the other teams presenting on the same day as you.
* Part of the assessment will concern the complexity of your project.
  Pick something achievable, but aim to push yourself.

## Presentation guidelines

* Your presentation's duration should be no more than 15 minutes.
* A five-minute Q&A period will follow each presentation.
* Describe the following in your talk:
    - The motivation: _why_ do we care to program in this way / have this language feature?
    - Your implementation / contribution: What specifically did you do? What challenges did you
      face?
    - Background: where do we find this feature in the wild? What is its history? References to the
      research literature.
    - Conclusion: future directions for this project, related existing work that already expands on
      these ideas, recap

## Report guidelines

* Your report should be between 6 and 10 pages depending on the complexity of your project, written
  in the style of a CS conference paper.
* Sections:
  - abstract: high-level summary of the entire paper
  - introduction: explaining the motivation, history, and laying out the paper
  - development: describe your specific contribution, implementation technique, challenges faced
  - conclusion: future directions for this project, related existing work that already expands on
    these ideas, recap
